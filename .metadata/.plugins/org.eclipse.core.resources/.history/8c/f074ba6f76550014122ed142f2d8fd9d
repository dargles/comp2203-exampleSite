- nothing left to do on the todo list!

Note: there was a lot learnt about browser compatibility in doing the 
responsive design properly.  IE handles block elements differently (and 
not according to the W3 spec).  At the moment, it looks to me like it's 
important to (i) avoid using margin (i.e. set it to zero everywhere, and 
(ii) think carefully about which element to put the required padding onto.  
There are sites out there that do a good job of explaining how to get 
compatible displays, even across IE and everything else.

all completed by 16-10-2014 (see above)

1) Need to do notes to reflect steps 5 & 6:
   - step 5 introduces the ini file: DONE
   - step 6 does the fancy menu stuff: DONE
2) Introduce an e.g. demonstrating true responsive design: DONE (step8)
3) Maybe an e.g. demonstrating how CSS3 design can be made backwards 
   compatible: DONE (step7)
4) Note "mobile first":
   - maybe should be "legacy first, mobile second"
   - note that "mobile first" (or second) *doesn't* mean first in the CSS!
   DONE (did all of this in step8)
