Notes for step3
===============

This example switches from using html to using an html page object - you can see the file in the library subdirectory, called "htmlPage.php".

Again, I've altered a few minor details from the slides in the lecture to make sure things are visible to you.  And as before, you can inspect the individual page's code by downloading it and looking at it in a text editor.
