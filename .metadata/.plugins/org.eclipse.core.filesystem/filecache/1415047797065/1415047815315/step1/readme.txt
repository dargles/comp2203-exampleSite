Notes for step1
===============

The pages here illustrate what you get if you just code in HTML5 and don't include any style information.  The semantic structure is there, but the "prettiness" is not - yet.

I've altered a few minor details from the slides in the lecture because:
a) if I name the first page index.html, you won't see anything here except the working site, and
b) to make it a little more complete (the slide set is incomplete in the lecture notes).

If you click on one of the pages, you'll go in to the website display (and see how rubbish it looks at this stage ;-) ).  If you want to see the code that makes up a particular page, you will need to right-click it (or whatever you do on an Apple) and download the page first, then load it up into a text editor (not a browser).
