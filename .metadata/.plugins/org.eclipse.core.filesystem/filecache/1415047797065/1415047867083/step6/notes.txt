responsive design
=================

1. Before we start: specifying
     max-width, and
     min-width
   makes a good deal of sense.

2. There's also the viewport meta-tag that helps with mobile devices:
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

3. Now we can get on with designing our site for different widths:
     @media screen and (max-width:480px) {}
