Notes for step2
===============

I've left page1.html as it was, so only page2, page3 and page4.html link to "normal.css" which is held in the "library" sub-dirctory.  This means that it is very easy to see the difference the CSS makes!

As before, I've altered a few minor details from the slides in the lecture to make sure things are visible to you.  And as before, you can inspect the individual page's code by downloading it and looking at it in a text editor.
