Notes for step7
===============

The task tackled in step7 is to make the site compatible with legacy browsers.  Older 
versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari and the like are straighforward.  It's IE, and 
especially IE6 that's the challenge! 


As before, you can inspect the code by downloading it and looking at it in a text editor; 
but to look at the php pages, you'll need to download the zip file, otherwise they'll be 
interpreted by the server before they're made available.
