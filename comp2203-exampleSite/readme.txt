Example Websites in argles.org/examples
=======================================

The various sub-directories in this part of the website each contain some example code that fits with the lecture course I'm running (Applications of Scripting).  They are designed to take you through the steps for building of a simple, but complete website, and illustrating the various points made in each lecture.

As with this main directory, you are able to browse each sub-directory.  This means you can see what files are there, you can download the individual page files, and you can see what's going on, even when we're using php (normally you couldn't see the source code with php files).

There will also be another readme.txt in each sub-directory explaining any issues with that particular version of the website.

A quick guide to the examples:

* step1: illustrates the content of lecture "1e" given on Friday 4th October.
         It demonstrates basic HTML5 with no style definitions.

* step2: illustrates the content of lecture "2d" given on Friday 11th October.
         It demonstrates the effect of adding style definitions in a CSS.

* step3: illustrates the content of lecture "4a" planned for Tuesday 22nd October.
         It demonstrates the effect of converting our html page to an oophp object.

* step4: illustrates the content of lecture "4b" planned for Tuesday 22nd October.
         It demonstrates the effectiveness of creating a little oophp-based library
         that allows the rapid creation of a new website.

* step5: This is ready to back up a lecture that isn't planned in yet...!  It
         introduces an "ini" file as a way of configuring key values for our
         boilerplate website.  It makes the maintenance of the site much easier; 
         but it also makes it much simpler if we want to re-use our boilerplate 
         for several different sites.
