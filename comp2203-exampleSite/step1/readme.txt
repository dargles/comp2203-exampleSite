Notes for step1
===============

The pages here illustrate what you get if you just code in HTML5 and don't include any style 
information.  The semantic structure is there, but the "prettiness" is not - yet.

I've altered a few minor details from the slides in the lecture to make it a little more complete:

1) I've added a page2.html
2) In page2, I've also added the line in the <head> section that declares the character coding.
    So you can check that page1 doesn't validate, but page2 does.

If you click on one of the pages, you'll go in to the website display (and see how rubbish it 
looks at this stage ;-) ).  If you want to see the code that makes up a particular page, you 
will need to right-click it (or whatever you do on an Apple) and download the page first, then 
load it up into a text editor (not a browser).
