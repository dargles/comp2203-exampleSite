Notes for step2
===============

I've left page1 and page2.html as they were, so only page3 and page4.html link to "normal.css" 
which is held in the "library" sub-dirctory.  This means that it is very easy to see the 
difference the CSS makes!

As before, you can inspect an individual page's code by downloading it and looking at it in a 
text editor.
