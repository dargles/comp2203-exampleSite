Notes for step5
===============

We now introduce a "partials" ini file ("partials.ini" in the <library> directory).  This 
enables us to remove signature data that is the same from page to page, but which alters 
from website to website, into a separate, easy to update file. 

The partials files ("templatexxx.html") have been updated to allow update from the ini file.

The partials class file ("partials.php") has been updated to make the updates happen at the 
right moment.

As before, you can inspect the individual pages' code by downloading it and looking at it in a 
text editor.
