1) Need to do notes to reflect steps 5 & 6:
   - step 5 introuces the ini file
   - step 6 does the fancy menu stuff
2) Introduce an e.g. demonstrating true responsive design.
3) Maybe an e.g. demonstrating how CSS3 design can be made backwards compatible.
4) Note "mobile first":
   - maybe should be "legacy first, mobile second"
   - note that "mobile first" (or second) *doesn't* mean first in the CSS!
